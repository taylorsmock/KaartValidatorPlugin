======

This is a plugin used by Kaart for validation purposes.
  
Build
=====  
A JOSM plugin is built as a single jar. We use ant to build.

See build.xml in this directory and update the plugin specific properties in the
configuration section.

To get an command overview run
    > ant help

To build the plugin run
    > ant  dist

To install the generated plugin locally (in you default plugin directory) run
    > ant  install

The generated plugin jar is not automatically available in JOSMs plugin configuration
dialog. You have to check it in first.

Use the ant target 'publish' to check in the plugin and make it available to other
JOSM users:
    set the properties commit.message and plugin.main.version
and run
    > ant  publish
